subtraction:
1) mask off bits and save to a long
2) add an effective 1 to the mantissa bits (put a one at bit #52 or w/e)
3) find which exponent of the 2 dominates, then set the other exponent to it, right shifting an equal amount
5) find out if the new result is negative, make it positive, but set the sign bit
6) normalize it by shifting to the right or left till there is a 1 again in bit #53, with only zeros to the left of it
7) delete that leading one
8) write it out to however you convert it, and yeah, the idea there is that if its a-b, but b is negative, it would add the 2
oh, and if both exponents are the same, then what I do is add one to each exponent, and divide the mantissa's by 2, as there is some weird things that happen when you don't do that for some reason?
4) multiply these mantissa's by the sign, and subtract them
(if you don't just reconfigure to avoid the situation where that's necessary)
