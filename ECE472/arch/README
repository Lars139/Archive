PART2:
By obeserving multiple execution of the code, it is very noticable the spike
in latency around 32KB and between 4MB-8MB (specifically around 6MB). The
latency on those spots are roughly greater than 50% of the previous allocated
memory. This occurance indicates that on Flip server
    L1 cache has a size of 32KB
    L2 cache has a size of ~6MB
Once the data size exceed the 6MB threshold, the process has to fetch the new
information from  the memory

PART3 & 4:
printf("__BIG_ENDIAN__") and printf("__LITTLE_ENDIAN__")
in macro/det_endiness() are intentinoally swapped. Not sure why
the program executes __BIG_ENDIAN__ when it's little endian on Flip
